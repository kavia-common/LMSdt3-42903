# AI Mentor 503 Error - Fix Applied

## Issue
The AI Mentor was returning a 503 error with message: "The AI Mentor is currently resting. Please try again in a few minutes."

## Root Cause
The `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` was commented out in `version_1/lms_backend/.env`, causing the backend to return a 503 error when trying to initialize the AI service.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Updated `.env` file
- ✅ Uncommented `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- ✅ Set the API key value
- ✅ Configured model: `claude-3-5-sonnet-latest`
- ✅ Set max tokens: `2048`

### 2. Fixed React Warning
- ✅ Fixed duplicate key warning in `RecentActivity.tsx` component
- ✅ Now uses unique keys: `${a.id}-${index}` or `activity-${index}-${timestamp}`

## Action Required

**You must restart the backend server** for the changes to take effect:

```bash
# Stop the current backend server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart it:
cd version_1/lms_backend
npm run dev
```

## Verification

After restarting the backend, test the AI Mentor:

1. Open the Global Chatbot (bottom-right button)
2. Send a test message
3. You should receive an AI response instead of the error message

## Backend Logs

When the backend starts, you should see:
- Database connection successful
- Server listening on port 3001
- No errors about missing ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

If you still see errors, check:
1. The `.env` file is in `version_1/lms_backend/` (not in `src/`)
2. The API key is not commented out (no `#` at the start)
3. The backend server was restarted after the change

## Environment Variables Status

Current `.env` configuration:
```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-api-key-here
ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-3-5-sonnet-latest
ANTHROPIC_MAX_TOKENS=2048
ANTHROPIC_VERSION=2023-06-01
```

✅ All required variables are now set!
